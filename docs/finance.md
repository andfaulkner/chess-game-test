Leveraged: when a company borrows money to invest into
-   e.g. invest in 2-to-1, 3-to-1, where every 3 dollars is borrowed to each 1 held
    -   These are good long-term bets

    -   QQQ: good returns

    -   Look into these for long-term

    -   Tech ETFs are leveraged
        -   However, they're volatile
        -   Also they're at risk of regulation
        -   Probably avoid in 20222


-   The Mackenzie stuff is really good
    -   High returns, good long-term prospects


Pretty good: Sunrun


ETFs
====
-   Exchange-traded funds
    -   Issue: they don't own the shares, it's representing them
        -   You're buying swaps
        -   Issue: you're taking up the risk of the hedge fund
            -   Hedge funds are buying the other side of the deal
        -   Someone has to be betting against a swap to work
    -   ETFs are one step back from

-   ETFs have always been treated as a really safe bet

HSX (Horizons S & P 500)
-   This is a good bet
